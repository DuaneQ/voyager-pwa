# Frontend Migration to Cloud SQL - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Successfully migrated the frontend search hook from Firestore to Cloud SQL RPC.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/hooks/useSearchItineraries.tsx`

**Before:** Used Firestore queries with client-side filtering
**After:** Calls Cloud SQL RPC function with server-side filtering

#### Key Changes:
- ✅ Removed Firestore imports and queries
- ✅ Added `httpsCallable` from Firebase Functions
- ✅ Replaced `fetchFromFirestore()` with `fetchFromCloudSQL()`
- ✅ Removed `applyClientSideFilters()` - **all filtering now done server-side**
- ✅ Only client-side filter remaining: exclude current user's itineraries (can't be done server-side without auth context)
- ✅ Track viewed itineraries in `viewedItinerariesRef` and pass to RPC as `excludedIds`

### 2. Server-Side Filters (in Cloud SQL Function)

The `searchItineraries` RPC now handles ALL filtering:
- ✅ Destination match
- ✅ Gender match (with "No Preference" support)
- ✅ Status match (with "No Preference" support)  
- ✅ Sexual orientation match (with "No Preference" support)
- ✅ **Age range filtering** (candidate.age BETWEEN lowerRange AND upperRange)
- ✅ **Date overlap filtering** (candidate dates overlap with user dates)
- ✅ Exclude viewed itineraries (via excludedIds parameter)

### 3. Client-Side Filter (Minimal)

Only ONE filter remains on the client:
- ❌ **Exclude current user's itineraries** - Can't be done server-side without passing auth context

This is intentional and necessary because:
1. The server doesn't have access to the current user's auth context
2. The user's own itineraries should never appear in search results
3. This is a simple filter (just check `userInfo.uid !== currentUserId`)

## Expected Results with Joy's Test Data

When Joy searches with her itinerary:
- **Destination:** Miami, FL, USA
- **Dates:** Nov 11-30, 2025
- **Age Range:** 18-100
- **Gender:** Female
- **Status:** couple
- **Sexual Orientation:** No Preference

**Expected Results: 12 matching itineraries**

### Should Match (12):
1. test-match-perfect-1 (Age 25)
2. test-match-perfect-2 (Age 30)
3. test-match-perfect-3 (Age 35)
4. test-match-perfect-4 (Age 40)
5. test-match-perfect-5 (Age 45)
6. test-match-age-young-18 (Age 18 - lower bound)
7. test-match-age-old-100 (Age 100 - upper bound)
8. test-match-orientation-gay (Gay - matches "No Preference")
9. test-match-orientation-lesbian (Lesbian - matches "No Preference")
10. test-match-orientation-bisexual (Bisexual - matches "No Preference")
11. test-match-dates-overlap (Nov 5-15 overlaps with Nov 11-30)
12. test-match-dates-containing (Nov 1 - Dec 15 contains Nov 11-30)

### Should NOT Match (17):
- 2 age out of range (17, 101)
- 3 status mismatches (Single, Married, Divorced)
- 2 gender mismatches (Male, Non-binary)
- 2 date mismatches (ends before Nov 11, starts after Nov 30)
- 3 destination mismatches (New York, LA, Chicago)
- 3 viewed itineraries (excluded by excludedIds)
- 2 multiple failures

## Testing

### In Browser Console:
When you search, you should see:
```
✅ Cloud SQL RPC returned 12 results, 12 after removing current user's itineraries
```

If you see:
```
✅ Cloud SQL RPC returned 0 results...
```
Then the RPC function isn't finding matches. Check:
1. Is the Cloud SQL proxy running?
2. Are the test itineraries in the database?
3. Are the search parameters correct?

### Verify in UI:
1. Log in as Joy (OPoJ6tPN3DaCAXxCmXwGFjOF7SI3)
2. Navigate to Search page
3. Select your Miami itinerary
4. You should see 12 matches to swipe through
5. After swiping through all 12, you should see "No more matches"

## Files Modified

- `src/hooks/useSearchItineraries.tsx` - Replaced Firestore with Cloud SQL RPC
- `src/utils/clientSideFilters.ts` - **No longer used** (can be removed or kept for legacy support)

## Important Notes

1. **No More Client-Side Filtering** - The complex filtering logic is now server-side only
2. **Age Field Required** - The RPC function expects `age` to be populated in itinerary records
3. **Viewed Tracking** - Itinerary IDs are tracked locally and passed as `excludedIds` to avoid re-showing
4. **Performance** - Server-side filtering is much faster than client-side (no need to fetch large result sets)

## Deployment Status

- ✅ Backend RPC function deployed to mundo1-dev
- ✅ Test data seeded (28 itineraries in traval-dev database)
- ✅ Frontend hook updated to use RPC
- ⏳ **Waiting for frontend rebuild/deploy to test in UI**

## Next Steps

1. **Test the UI** - Clear localStorage and test search with Joy's itinerary
2. **Verify Console Logs** - Should show "Cloud SQL RPC returned 12 results"
3. **Swipe Through All Matches** - Verify all 12 matches appear correctly
4. **Check "No More Matches"** - After all matches, should show example itinerary or empty state
5. **Monitor Function Logs** - Watch for any errors in Cloud Functions console

**Migration Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Frontend now using Cloud SQL RPC!
