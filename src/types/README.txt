This folder contains all shared TypeScript types for user profiles, itineraries, messages, and other domain models. Use these types throughout the app for consistency.

- UserProfile.ts: The canonical user profile type. Use this everywhere for user data.
- Remove or merge any duplicate or legacy types (such as profile.d.ts) to avoid confusion.
