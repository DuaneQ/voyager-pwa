## 📋 Pre-Deployment Requirements

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Production Cloud SQL Instance
Instance: mundo1-1:us-central1:traval-prod
Database: traval-prod
User: voyageruser
Password: [Stored in Secret Manager]

# Firebase Project
Project: mundo1-1
Region: us-central1
```

### Required Secrets
```bash
# Set these in GCP Secret Manager
- DATABASE_PASSWORD
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (if not already set)
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
cd functions

# Start Cloud SQL proxy to production
./cloud_sql_proxy --instances=mundo1-1:us-central1:traval-prod=tcp:5433 &

# Run Prisma migrations
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://voyageruser:PROD_PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5433/traval-prod" \
  npm run prisma:migrate:deploy

# Migrate data from Firestore to Cloud SQL
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://voyageruser:PROD_PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5433/traval-prod" \
  FIREBASE_PROJECT=mundo1-1 \
  npm run migrate:firestore-to-cloudsql
```

### Step 2: Deploy Cloud Functions
```bash
cd functions
firebase use mundo1-1
firebase deploy --only functions:searchItineraries,functions:listItinerariesForUser,functions:createItinerary,functions:updateItinerary,functions:deleteItinerary
```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend
```bash
cd ..
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
```bash
cd functions
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://voyageruser:PROD_PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5433/traval-prod" \
  FIREBASE_PROJECT=mundo1-1 \
  npx ts-node scripts/verify-production-deployment.ts
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify:

- [ ] Search returns correct results
- [ ] Blocked users are excluded (bidirectional)
- [ ] Viewed itineraries persist and are excluded
- [ ] Like/match functionality works
- [ ] AI generation works (premium users)
- [ ] Response times < 2s
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Database connections stable

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### Option 1: Rollback Functions
```bash
gcloud functions deploy searchItineraries --version=PREVIOUS_VERSION_ID
```

### Option 2: Emergency Firestore Fallback
Revert `useSearchItineraries.tsx` to use Firestore queries, redeploy frontend.

### Option 3: Database Restore
```bash
gcloud sql backups restore BACKUP_ID --backup-instance=traval-prod
```

---

## 📊 Key Features Deployed

### 1. Cloud SQL Backend
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Server-side filtering (age, gender, status, dates)
- Optimized queries with indexes
- Connection pooling

### 2. Bidirectional Blocking
- Users can block each other
- Blocked users don't appear in search results
- Works in both directions automatically
- Server-side filtering (secure)

### 3. Search Optimization
- Page size: 10 results per query
- Date overlap filtering
- Age range filtering
- Excluded viewed itineraries
- Excluded blocked users

### 4. Performance Improvements
- Reduced payload size (10 vs 50 results)
- Faster queries with indexes
- Client-side caching with localStorage
- 5-minute search cache

---

## 📈 Expected Impact

### User Experience
- Faster search results
- More relevant matches (bidirectional blocking)
- Better privacy (blocked users excluded)
- Smoother pagination

### Technical Benefits
- Reduced Firebase costs (Cloud SQL cheaper at scale)
- Better query performance
- Easier to add complex filters
- Standard SQL tooling and monitoring

---

## 🔍 Monitoring After Deployment

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Search Response Time**: Should be < 2s
2. **Error Rate**: Should be < 1%
3. **Database CPU**: Should be < 70%
4. **Database Connections**: Should be < 100
5. **User Complaints**: Monitor support tickets

### Where to Monitor
- Firebase Console: Cloud Functions metrics
- GCP Console: Cloud SQL metrics
- Application Logs: Check for errors
- User Feedback: Support tickets/Slack

---

## 👥 Team Sign-Off

- [ ] **Developer**: Code reviewed and tested
- [ ] **QA**: All tests passed
- [ ] **DevOps**: Infrastructure ready
- [ ] **Product**: Features approved

## 📞 Emergency Contacts

- **On-Call Engineer**: [Your Contact]
- **DevOps Lead**: [DevOps Contact]
- **Database Admin**: [DBA Contact]

## 📝 Post-Deployment Notes

### What to Test First
1. Search with filters
2. Block a user and verify exclusion
3. Create new itinerary
4. Like/match flow
5. AI generation (premium)

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Slow queries**: Check indexes, increase Cloud SQL instance size
2. **Connection errors**: Verify VPC connector, check instance status
3. **Missing data**: Re-run migration script with `--skip-existing`
4. **Blocking not working**: Check userInfo.blocked array is populated

---
