# AI Itinerary Generation - Permission Issues Fix

## Date: August 2025
## Status: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Firebase Permissions Fixed
## Update: August 24, 2025 - Success modal issue was separate bug (see AI_GENERATION_SUCCESS_MODAL_FIX.md)

## Problem Summary
Firebase Cloud Functions were unable to write to the `itineraries` Firestore collection due to security rules blocking the service account.

## Root Cause
Firestore security rules were preventing Cloud Functions from writing progress updates and results.

## Solution Applied
Updated `firestore.rules` to allow Cloud Function service account access for generation writes to the `itineraries` collection. Ensure rules are scoped to the functions service account or use a robust conditional that checks `request.auth.token`/service account identity rather than blanket allow.

Example (do not use blanket allow in production):

```javascript
// Scoped rule example (illustrative)
match /databases/{database}/documents {
	match /itineraries/{itineraryId} {
		allow create, update: if request.auth != null && (request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId || request.auth.token.admin == true);
	}
}
```

## Files Modified
- ✅ `firestore.rules` (deployed version)
- ⚠️ `dev.firebase.rules` (updated for consistency)

## Expected Results
- ✅ AI generation completes successfully
- ✅ Progress tracking works properly  
- ✅ Results saved to Firestore correctly
