# Feature Development Template

## 1. Feature Requirements

**Feature Name:** [Name of the new feature]

**User Problem Solved:** 
- What user need does this feature address?
- How does it improve the travel companion experience?

**User Story:**
AS A [type of user] I WANT TO [action/functionality] SO THAT [benefit/outcome]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can create journal entries with text, photos, and location
- [ ] Entries can be marked as private or shared with travel companions
- [ ] Entries are organized by trip/itinerary
- [ ] Users can view a timeline of their entries

## 2. Data Model Updates

**New Types/Interfaces:**
```typescript
export interface JournalEntry {
  id: string;
  connectionId: string;  // Links to the travel connection
  userId: string;        // Creator of the entry
  title: string;
  content: string;
  photos: string[];      // Array of image URLs
  location: GeoPoint;    // Firebase GeoPoint
  timestamp: Timestamp;
  isPrivate: boolean;    // Whether entry is shared with companions
}
```
Firebase Collection Structure:

- `journalEntries` (collection)
  - `{entryId}` (document)
    - `connectionId`: string
    - `userId`: string
    - `title`: string
    - `content`: string
    - `photos`: array
    - `location`: geopoint
    - `timestamp`: timestamp
    - `isPrivate`: boolean

3. Component Structure
New Components Needed:

TripJournal.tsx
JournalEntry.tsx
Component Hierarchy:

```
Trip
└── TripJournal
    ├── JournalEntry
    └── JournalEntry
```
4. Implementation Plan
Step 1: Create Basic Component Structure

Create `TripJournal.tsx` and `JournalEntry.tsx` files
Define props and state for each component
Step 2: Implement Core Functionality

Implement logic to create, read, update, and delete journal entries
Connect components to Firebase/data layer
Step 3: Add UI Elements

Implement user interface for trip journal
Add styling to match app design
Step 4: Add Error Handling

Identify possible error scenarios (e.g., network issues, validation errors)
Implement error states and fallbacks in the UI
5. Testing Strategy

Unit tests for individual components and functions
Integration tests for Firebase interactions
End-to-end tests for user flows
6. Integration Points
List affected components:

Trip component needs to be updated to include trip journal
Route changes required in AppRouter
State Management Updates:

Changes needed to context/providers to manage trip journal state
New state variables required for journal entries
7. UI/UX Considerations
Mobile Responsiveness:

Ensure trip journal is usable on mobile devices
Consider touch interactions for adding/editing entries
Accessibility:

Ensure keyboard navigation is possible
Provide text alternatives for non-text content
Ensure sufficient color contrast
8. Deployment Checklist

<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Feature flags configured if needed
<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Firebase security rules updated
<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Performance impact assessed
<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Analytics tracking added

## Example Implementation
