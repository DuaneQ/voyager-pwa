Title: S3.1 — Login Screen (RN-web)

Goal
- Port the existing Login UI to React Native primitives so it runs on mobile and web via react-native-web. Reuse `shared/services/auth` for authentication.

Acceptance criteria
- RN implementation of Login screen renders on mobile (Expo) and web (react-native-web).
- Email/password login works and uses `shared/services/auth`.
- Google Sign-In button triggers the shared auth flow (where possible) and provides a fallback on web.
- On successful login the session is stored via the shared storage adapter and the UI navigates to the Home screen.

Tasks
1. Replace MUI TextField / Button with RN `TextInput` and `Button` (or RN Paper equivalents).
2. Wire form validation to match existing behavior (show errors inline).
3. Use `shared/services/auth.signInWithEmail()` for login; handle and map errors to UI.
4. Add Google Sign-In button that calls `shared/services/auth.signInWithGoogle()` — provide a web fallback that opens OAuth in a new tab if native Google Sign-In is not available.
5. Store session via `shared/services/session.setSession()` and navigate to Home on success.
6. Add unit tests for validation logic and integration tests for the screen (Jest + RN Testing Library).

Estimate: 1–2 days

Dependencies
- S2 (shared extraction for auth & storage)

Notes
- Keep styles responsive and test on multiple screen sizes for RN-web parity.
