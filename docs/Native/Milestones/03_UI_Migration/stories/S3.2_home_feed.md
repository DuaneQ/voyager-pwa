Title: S3.2 — Home Feed / Video Feed

Goal
- Port the main feed (video / itinerary cards) UI to RN components, including lazy loading, card interactions, and video playback integration.

Acceptance criteria
- Feed displays a scrollable list of itinerary cards on mobile and web with similar layout.
- Video playback works using `expo-av` (mobile) and an appropriate web fallback for RN-web.
- Card interactions (like, save, share) call shared services for tracking and update UI optimistically.

Tasks
1. Create `FeedList` using `FlatList` for performance and virtualization.
2. Implement `FeedCard` UI with image/video thumbnail, title, meta, and actions.
3. Integrate `expo-av` for video playback on mobile; use a web-friendly video component for RN-web.
4. Wire like/save actions to `shared/services/usageTracking` and `shared/services/itineraries`.
5. Add lazy loading / pagination behavior (infinite scroll) using existing search/cache logic extracted to shared.
6. Add unit and integration tests for feed behavior and optimistic updates.

Estimate: 3–5 days

Dependencies
- S2 (shared services for itineraries, usage tracking)
- S4 (video media integration for performant playback)

Notes
- Test on low-end devices to verify memory use for video thumbnails and autoplay behavior.
