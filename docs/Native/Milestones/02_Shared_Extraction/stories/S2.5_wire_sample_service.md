Title: S2.5 — Wire sample shared service into mobile PoC

Goal
- Demonstrate a working integration by using a `shared` service (e.g., session or usage tracking) from the `/mobile` PoC.

Acceptance criteria
- `/shared/services/session.ts` exposes `getSession()` and `setSession()`.
- `/mobile` bootstrap configures the `asyncStorageAdapter` and calls `getSession()` to render login state.
- The PoC shows the same session state on web (via RN-web) and mobile.

Tasks
- Implement `shared/services/session.ts` using `StorageAdapter`.
- Add bootstrap wiring in `/mobile/src/App.tsx` to configure adapters.
- Update the PoC Login screen to show session state.

Estimate: 0.5–1 day

Dependencies
- S2.1, S2.4

Notes
- Keep this story small and focused so we have a quick verification that adapters and shared code work.
