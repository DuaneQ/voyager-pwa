Title: S2.4 — Implement storage & notifications adapters

Goal
- Define adapter interfaces in `/shared/adapters` and implement web/mobile versions for storage and notifications.

Acceptance criteria
- `shared/src/adapters/storage.ts` defines the `StorageAdapter` interface.
- `web/src/adapters/localStorageAdapter.ts` implements the adapter.
- `mobile/src/adapters/asyncStorageAdapter.ts` implements the adapter using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.
- `shared/src/adapters/notifications.ts` defines a `NotificationsAdapter` interface.
- `mobile` implements `expo-notifications` adapter; `web` implements a no-op or web-push stub.
- Example `shared/services/session.ts` uses the `StorageAdapter` and is wired in mobile and web bootstrap code.

Tasks
- Create adapter interfaces in `shared/src/adapters`.
- Implement web/mobile adapters.
- Wire adapters in platform bootstrap code and test with the PoC.

Estimate: 1–2 days

Dependencies
- S2.1, S2.2

Notes
- For notifications the web impl can be a no-op at first (we'll add web push later if needed).
