Title: S2.1 â€” Create `/shared` workspace and tooling

Goal
- Create a `shared` package at repo root that other packages can import via npm workspaces and TypeScript path mappings.

Acceptance criteria
- `shared/package.json` exists with `main`/`types` and `build` scripts.
- Root `package.json` includes `workspaces` entry for `/shared` and `/mobile`.
- `tsconfig.json` path aliases updated so imports like `shared/*` resolve.
- Minimal README in `/shared` documenting usage.

Tasks
- Add `shared/package.json` with name `@voyager/shared` and TypeScript entry points.
- Update root `package.json` workspaces: `"workspaces": ["mobile","shared"]`.
- Update root `tsconfig.json` `paths` to include `@voyager/shared/*` mapping to `shared/src/*`.
- Add basic `shared/src/index.ts` and `shared/src/types.ts`.
- Add test runner configuration (Jest) for shared.

Estimate: 0.5 day

Dependencies
- None

Notes
- Use `npm workspaces` since you selected npm for package management.
