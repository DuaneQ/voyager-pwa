Title: S2.2 — Extract types & pure utils into `/shared`

Goal
- Move TypeScript types and pure utility functions (date formatting, serialization, normalization) into `/shared` so both web and RN-web can use them.

Acceptance criteria
- All `src/types/**` files are moved into `shared/src/types/**` with tests passing.
- Pure utils from `src/utils/**` moved into `shared/src/utils/**` and exported from `shared`.
- Web and mobile builds (or at least compile steps) succeed after updating imports.

Tasks
- Identify files in `src/types` and `src/utils` to move.
- Move files into `shared/src/types` and `shared/src/utils`.
- Update imports across the repo to reference `@voyager/shared` (via tsconfig paths).
- Run TypeScript compile and fix any type errors.
- Add Jest tests for critical utils.

Estimate: 1–2 days

Dependencies
- S2.1 (shared workspace created)

Notes
- Do not move functions that depend on `window` or DOM.
