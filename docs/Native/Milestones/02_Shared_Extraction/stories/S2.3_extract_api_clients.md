Title: S2.3 — Extract API clients & server-callable wrappers

Goal
- Move Firebase callable wrappers and other API client code to `/shared` and make them accept a platform-agnostic http/callable client.

Acceptance criteria
- Server-callable wrappers (functions previously calling `httpsCallable`) are available under `shared/services/*` and are easily mockable.
- API clients do not import browser-only libraries.
- Unit tests exist for the client wrappers using mocks.

Tasks
- Identify API client files (functions folder, hooks that call httpsCallable).
- Refactor to accept an injected `callableClient` parameter or to read from a thin wrapper in `/shared/adapters/firebaseClient`.
- Add unit tests with mocked responses.
- Update callers in web and mobile to provide the platform-specific callable client (web: firebase js SDK, mobile: firebase js SDK or a different client depending on strategy).

Estimate: 1–2 days

Dependencies
- S2.1, S2.2

Notes
- Keep server-callable code platform-agnostic: don't assume window or DOM.
