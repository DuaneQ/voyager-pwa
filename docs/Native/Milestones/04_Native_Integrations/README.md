# Milestone 04 — Native Integrations

Goal
- Integrate payment, crash reporting, maps, and video features using native-capable libraries and EAS builds.

Stories
- S1: Stripe integration (stripe-react-native) and server-side PaymentIntent flow. Includes Apple IAP decision.
- S2: Crashlytics setup (EAS build, mapping files, RNFB or native integration)
- S3: Maps & places (react-native-maps, Places adapter)
- S4: Video playback and upload (expo-av / react-native-video) and device stress testing

Estimate: 1–3 weeks per integration (depending on complexity)

Notes
- Each story includes EAS build validation and CI integration.
