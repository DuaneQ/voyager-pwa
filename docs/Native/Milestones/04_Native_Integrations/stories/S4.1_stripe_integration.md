Title: S4.1 — Stripe Integration (stripe-react-native)

Goal
- Integrate `stripe-react-native` for payments and create server-side PaymentIntent flows. Decide and implement subscription strategy for iOS (IAP) and Android.

Acceptance criteria
- Native integration builds successfully via EAS and the payment flow can create a PaymentIntent on the server and complete a payment in-app.
- Server verifies and returns client secrets; the app confirms final status and grants entitlements.
- For subscriptions: implement Apple IAP flow for iOS (or document hybrid approach) and server-side verification.

Tasks
1. Add `stripe-react-native` to `mobile` dependencies and update `app.json`/EAS config for native build.
2. Implement server endpoints for PaymentIntent creation and subscription handling.
3. Implement client flow to collect payment details and confirm payment using the SDK.
4. Implement server-side entitlement logic to map payments/subscriptions to in-app privileges.
5. Add tests for server flow and E2E check for in-app payment.

Estimate: 2–4 weeks (includes backend and store policy work for subscriptions)

Dependencies
- EAS build (S5), server-side endpoints, decisions on iOS IAP strategy

Notes
- Apple IAP requirement: if AI generation is a subscription digital good consumed in-app, prefer Apple IAP for iOS subscriptions; use Stripe for web.
