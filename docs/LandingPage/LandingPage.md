You are a senior front-end developer creating a modern, high-converting landing page for a travel-tech app called **TravalPass**.

🎯 GOAL
Build an engaging marketing page that explains what TravalPass does, visually impresses visitors, and encourages them to sign up for the app.
The page must NOT be a login screen — it’s purely informational with a strong call-to-action leading to the signup flow.

💡 BRAND OVERVIEW
TravalPass is an AI-powered travel app that:
- Generates smart AI itineraries based on user preferences
- Matches travelers going to the same destination at the same time
- Your personal travel agent that provides complete itinerary for your trip that you can share with friends
- Helps people connect and chat before traveling

🌍 STYLE
- Clean, modern, mobile-first layout
- Responsive
- Color palette: blues and whites (feel free to add subtle gradients)
- Rounded buttons and soft shadows
- Use responsive flex or grid layout
- Include smooth scrolling and fade-in animations
- Use a simple Google Font like Inter or Poppins
- Icons should be travel-related (airplane, globe, chat, hotel, etc.)

📄 PAGE SECTIONS

1️⃣ **Hero Section**
   - Large background image or subtle looping travel video
   - Headline: Traval the world together.”
   - Subheadline: “TravalPass matches you with travelers headed to the same destination during the same dates — and builds your AI itinerary in seconds.”
   - Primary CTA button: “Get Started Free”
   - Secondary CTA (scroll anchor): “See How It Works”

2️⃣ **Problem → Solution Section**
   - Two-column layout:
       - Left: Image or animation of a frustrated traveler searching multiple sites
       - Right: Headline “Stop juggling travel apps.”
         Subtext: “TravalPass eliminates the chaos of planning by combining AI itineraries, traveler matching, and smart search in one place.”
       - Optional button: “Create Your Free Travel Profile”

3️⃣ **Feature Highlights Section**
   - Use 3-4 feature cards with icons and short text:
       - ✈️ AI Itineraries — Personalized plans tailored to your style.
       - 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Traveler Matching — Meet people going to the same destination.
       - 🏨 Smart Search — Find and compare flights, stays, and attractions.
       - 💬 Connect & Chat — Talk to matches before your trip.
   - Make cards hover-animated with a soft scale-up effect.

4️⃣ **Demo Video Section**
   - Full-width container with embedded video player.
   - Title above: “See TravalPass in Action.”
   - Under the video: “Watch how easy it is to plan, match, and travel together.”

   - Large centered text: “Join thousands of travelers planning their next adventure.”
   - Prominent button: “Sign Up Now”
   - Secondary link: “Learn More About TravalPass”

🎥 DEMO VIDEO PLACEHOLDER
Embed a video element (YouTube or local MP4) so I can replace it later with my actual demo file.

⚙️ TECH REQUIREMENTS
- Use semantic HTML5 (header, main, section, footer)
- Use inline sx styling.  Look at the TravelPreferences tab to see how we implement responsive design.
- Include responsive breakpoints for mobile and desktop
- Add subtle animations (fade-in, slide-up)
- Optimize for performance and accessibility (alt text, aria labels)
- Include a placeholder logo in the top navigation

🧱 OUTPUT
Generate clean, production-ready HTML (or React component if in .jsx/.tsx file) that I can immediately preview in VS Code.
The structure should be modular enough for future expansion (like pricing or testimonials).
