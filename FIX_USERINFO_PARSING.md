# FIXED: userInfo.uid Issue âœ…

## Problem Identified

The Cloud SQL RPC was returning 15 matching itineraries, but they were ALL being filtered out on the client because `userInfo.uid` was undefined.

### Root Cause
Prisma was returning the `userInfo` JSON field as a **stringified JSON string** instead of a parsed object. This meant:
- `itinerary.userInfo` was a string like `'{"uid":"test-user-match-1",...}'`
- `itinerary.userInfo.uid` was `undefined` (can't access properties on a string)
- Client-side filter excluded all results because `!it.userInfo?.uid` was true

### The Fix

Updated `searchItineraries` function in `itinerariesRpc.ts` to parse JSON fields:

```typescript
// Parse JSON fields if they're strings (Prisma sometimes returns JSON as strings)
const parsedItems = items.map((item: any) => {
  const parsed = { ...item };
  
  // Parse userInfo if it's a string
  if (typeof parsed.userInfo === 'string') {
    try {
      parsed.userInfo = JSON.parse(parsed.userInfo);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('Failed to parse userInfo for item:', parsed.id, e);
    }
  }
  
  // Parse other JSON fields...
  return parsed;
});
```

This ensures that `userInfo.uid` is properly accessible in the frontend.

## Testing After Fix

1. **Refresh your browser** (or wait ~30 seconds for function to update)
2. **Select your Miami itinerary again**
3. **Check console logs** - you should now see:
   ```
   âœ… Cloud SQL RPC returned 15 results, 12 after removing current user's itineraries
   ```
   (3 are viewed itineraries that get excluded)

4. **You should now see matches!** ðŸŽ‰

## Expected Results

After the fix, you should see **12 matching itineraries**:
- 5 perfect matches (ages 25, 30, 35, 40, 45)
- 2 age edge cases (18, 100)
- 3 orientation matches (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual)
- 2 date overlaps

## Why This Happened

Prisma's JSON field handling varies depending on:
1. PostgreSQL version
2. Prisma version
3. How the JSON was inserted (string vs object)

Our test seed script stored `userInfo` as a JSON string:
```typescript
userInfo: JSON.stringify({ uid: "test-user-...", ... })
```

When Prisma reads it back, it returns the raw string instead of parsing it automatically. The fix ensures consistent parsing.

## Next Steps

This same fix should be applied to:
- `listItineraries` function
- `createItinerary` function  
- `updateItinerary` function

Anywhere we return itinerary data from Cloud SQL needs to parse JSON fields properly.
